# F5 Data Groups Management

## Overview

F5 Data Groups Management is a web application built with Flask that allows you to manage data groups on F5 BIG-IP devices. The application provides functionalities to create, update, delete, and import/export data groups.

## Features

- Create, update, and delete data groups
- Import data groups from files (CSV, JSON) and URLs
- Export data groups to CSV and JSON files
- Manage BIG-IP devices and deploy data groups to them
- Browse and manage data groups on BIG-IP devices

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `virtualenv` (optional but recommended)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_flask_app.git
cd my_flask_app
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

On macOS and Linux:

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create a secret key

A secret key is used to salt the device passwords in the devices.json file that is created when BIG-IPs are configured in the app. 

Run the following command in the root directory of the project to create a unique secret key. If this file is modified or deleted, you will need to remove all BIG-IPs from the application and re-add them after regenerating the file.

```sh
python3 create_secret_key.py
```

### Running the Application

```sh
python f5-dgm.py
```
